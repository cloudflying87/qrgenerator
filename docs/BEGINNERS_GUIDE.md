## üéØ What We're Building

**Project Example: Insurance EOB Tracker**

Imagine you have medical insurance and receive "Explanation of Benefits" (EOB) documents after doctor visits. These documents show:
- How much you've spent toward your deductible
- What categories expenses fall into (office visit, lab work, prescriptions, etc.)
- How much insurance paid vs. what you owe

We're going to build a web application that:
- Lets you upload or enter EOB data
- Tracks your total spending against your deductible
- Organizes expenses by category
- Shows you at a glance how much more you need to spend before insurance kicks in
- Displays charts and summaries of your healthcare spending

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working foundation for this project and know how to continue building it with AI assistance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Understanding the Tools

Before we start, let's understand what each tool does and why we need it.

### What is a Terminal?

**Think of it as:** A text-based way to talk to your computer

- **Mac**: Called "Terminal" - it's already installed
- **Windows**: Called "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
- **What it does**: Lets you type commands to make your computer do things (create folders, run programs, install software)
- **Why we need it**: Most programming tools are controlled through text commands

**Analogy**: If your computer's graphical interface (clicking icons) is like ordering food at a restaurant by pointing at pictures, the terminal is like ordering by speaking directly to the chef.

### What is Git?

**Think of it as:** A "save game" system for your code

- **What it does**: Keeps track of every change you make to your project
- **Why we need it**:
  - You can go back to any previous version if you break something
  - You can see what changed and when
  - You can collaborate with others without overwriting their work
  - It's like "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word, but much more powerful

**Analogy**: Like having an infinite undo button that remembers every version of your project forever.

### What is a Code Editor?

**Think of it as:** Microsoft Word, but for code

**What it does:** A text editor specifically designed for writing code that:
- Colors your code to make it easier to read (syntax highlighting)
- Suggests completions as you type (autocomplete)
- Helps you find and fix errors (linting)
- Integrates with tools like Git, terminals, and AI assistants

**Analogy**: You could write code in Notepad, just like you could write a novel there. But a good code editor gives you spell-check, grammar suggestions, formatting tools, and much more.

#### **Code Editors Comparison**

There are many code editors. Here's an honest comparison, especially for AI-assisted Django development:

---

**Best for:**
- Professional Python/Django developers
- Large projects (1000s of files)
- Data science (Jupyter notebooks built-in)

**AI capabilities:**
- GitHub Copilot plugin available
- JetBrains AI Assistant (paid feature)
- Less AI-focused than Cursor

---

**4. Sublime Text - Fastest Editor**

**Think of it as:** A sports car - fast, minimal, powerful

- ‚úÖ **Extremely fast** (opens instantly, handles huge files)
- ‚úÖ **Clean, distraction-free interface**
- ‚úÖ **Multiple cursors** (edit many places at once)
- ‚úÖ **Works without internet**
- ‚ùå **Limited AI integration** (few AI plugins)
- ‚ùå **Costs $99** (after trial period)
- ‚ùå **Smaller plugin ecosystem**

**Best for:**
- Experienced developers who value speed
- Editing config files, logs
- People who don't want AI help

**AI capabilities:**
- Basic Copilot support (unofficial)
- Limited compared to modern editors

---

**5. Vim / Neovim - For Keyboard Warriors**

**Think of it as:** A manual transmission racecar - incredibly powerful if you know how to drive it

- ‚úÖ **Works in terminal** (no GUI needed)
- ‚úÖ **Extremely customizable** (infinite configurations)
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard-only** (never touch mouse)
- ‚úÖ **Works on any system** (including servers)
- ‚úÖ **Growing AI support** (Copilot.vim, ChatGPT.nvim)
- ‚ùå **Steep learning curve** (takes weeks to become productive)
- ‚ùå **Not beginner-friendly** (need to learn modal editing)
- ‚ùå **Time investment** (configuring takes time)

**Best for:**
- Experienced developers
- People who work on remote servers
- Those who want ultimate keyboard efficiency

**AI capabilities:**
- Copilot.vim plugin (GitHub Copilot)
- ChatGPT.nvim (AI chat in Neovim)
- Requires manual setup

---

**6. Others Worth Mentioning**

**Atom** (deprecated, don't use)
- GitHub shut it down
- Use VSCode instead

**Notepad++** (Windows only)
- Too basic for modern development
- No AI support

**Replit** (browser-based)
- Good for learning basics
- Built-in AI (Ghostwriter)
- Not for serious projects

---

#### **My Recommendation for This Project**

**For absolute beginners following this guide:**
‚Üí **Start with VSCode** + GitHub Copilot (or free AI extensions)

**Why VSCode for beginners:**
1. This guide's screenshots and instructions use VSCode
2. Massive community (easy to find help)
3. Free forever
4. Great AI extensions available
5. Standard in the industry (learn once, use everywhere)

**If you want the BEST AI coding experience:**
‚Üí **Use Cursor** from day 1

**Why Cursor for AI learners:**
1. AI is built-in (no setup needed)
2. Highlight code ‚Üí Ask AI to explain it (perfect for learning)
3. AI sees your whole project (better suggestions)
4. Still compatible with all VSCode extensions
5. Feels like pair programming with an expert

**If you're already comfortable with another editor:**
‚Üí **Stick with what you know** and add AI plugins

**Don't use for learning:**
- ‚ùå Vim/Neovim (too much learning curve)
- ‚ùå PyCharm (overkill for beginners)
- ‚ùå Sublime (weak AI support)
- ‚ùå Notepad, TextEdit, or basic editors (you'll fight your tools)

---

#### **Practical Advice: Switching Editors Later**

**Good news:** Your code works in any editor!

- Code files are just text files
- You can switch editors anytime
- Many developers use different editors for different tasks

**Common pattern:**
1. Start with VSCode (learn basics)
2. Try Cursor (experience AI-first coding)
3. Stick with whichever feels better
4. Maybe try PyCharm later for large projects

**Bottom line:**
- **For this guide:** VSCode is recommended (free, popular, well-supported)
- **For AI-assisted learning:** Cursor is amazing (AI built-in, still based on VSCode)
- **Pick one and stick with it for 3 months** before switching (avoid tool-hopping)

The editor doesn't make you a better programmer - practice does. But a good editor with AI assistance will make learning faster and more enjoyable!

### What is Python?

**Think of it as:** The language we'll write in

- **What it does**: A programming language that's easy for humans to read and write
- **Why we need it**: Django (our web framework) is built with Python
- **Why Python**: It reads almost like English, making it perfect for beginners

**Analogy**: If building a website is like building a house, Python is the language you speak to tell the construction workers what to do.

### What is pyenv?

**Think of it as:** A manager for different versions of Python

- **What it does**: Lets you have multiple versions of Python on your computer
- **Why we need it**: Different projects might need different Python versions; this keeps them separate
- **Bonus**: Creates "virtual environments" - isolated workspaces for each project

**Analogy**: Like having different toolboxes for different jobs. Your plumbing toolbox doesn't mix with your electrical toolbox.

### What is Django?

**Think of it as:** A website construction kit

- **What it does**: Provides pre-built components for common website features (user login, database, admin panel, etc.)
- **Why we need it**: Instead of building everything from scratch, we get a professional foundation
- **What's included**:
  - Database system (stores your data)
  - User authentication (login/logout)
  - Admin interface (manage your data)
  - Security features (keeps hackers out)
  - URL routing (connects web addresses to pages)

**Analogy**: Building a website from scratch is like building a car from raw metal. Django is like getting a car chassis, engine, and wheels already assembled - you just customize it.

### What is SQLite?

**Think of it as:** A smart filing cabinet in a single file

- **What it does**: Stores all your application's data in organized tables
- **Why we're using it**:
  - Built into Python (no installation needed!)
  - Perfect for learning and personal projects
  - Just a single file you can see and backup easily
  - Fast enough for thousands of records
- **What it stores**: Your EOB entries, categories, spending amounts, user accounts, etc.

**Analogy**: You could keep all your data in separate text files scattered around, or you could use a self-contained filing system that keeps everything organized in one place. SQLite is that filing system.

**For beginners:** SQLite is perfect. When your app grows to thousands of users, you can easily upgrade to PostgreSQL later (takes 10 minutes). But for now, one less thing to install and manage!

## üíª Installing Everything You Need

Let's install each tool step by step. These instructions are for **Mac** (since you're on macOS). Windows users will have slightly different steps.

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Command + Space` (opens Spotlight search)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

You'll see a window with white or black background and a blinking cursor. This is your terminal.

**What you'll see**: Something like:
```
YourName@MacBook-Pro ~ %
```

This is called a "prompt" - it's waiting for you to type a command.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)

**What is Homebrew?** Think of it as an "App Store for developers" - it installs programming tools easily.

1. In Terminal, paste this command (copy everything on one line):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Press Enter
3. Enter your Mac password when prompted (you won't see characters as you type - this is normal)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation

**How to verify it worked**:
```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like: `Homebrew 4.x.x`

### Step 3: Install Git

**In Terminal, type:**
```bash
brew install git
```

Wait for it to finish, then verify:
```bash
git --version
```

You should see: `git version 2.x.x`

**Configure Git with your name and email:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" and the email with your actual information.

### Step 4: Install VSCode

**Two ways to install:**

**Option A: Download from website**
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Click the download button for Mac
3. Open the downloaded file
4. Drag "Visual Studio Code" to your Applications folder

**Option B: Install with Homebrew**
```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

**Verify**: Open VSCode by pressing `Command + Space`, typing "Visual Studio Code", and pressing Enter.

**IMPORTANT: Enable the `code` command**

After installing VSCode, you need to enable the `code` command so you can open folders from the terminal:

1. **Open VSCode** (if not already open)
2. Press **`Command + Shift + P`** (this opens the Command Palette)
3. Type: **"shell command"**
4. Click: **"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"**
5. You'll see a confirmation: "Shell command 'code' successfully installed"

**Test it:**
```bash
code --version
```

You should see VSCode version information.

**What this does:** Now you can open any folder in VSCode from terminal with `code .` or `code foldername`. This is essential for the Django setup wizard!

### Step 5: Install pyenv

**In Terminal:**
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

**Configure your shell to use pyenv:**

1. Check what shell you're using:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If it says `/bin/zsh`, you're using zsh (most modern Macs).

2. Add pyenv to your shell configuration:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Restart your terminal (close and reopen it) or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Verify:**
```bash
pyenv --version
```

### Step 6: Install Python with pyenv

**Install Python 3.13.3** (or latest version):
```bash
pyenv install 3.13.3
```

This takes 5-10 minutes.

**Set it as your global Python version:**
```bash
pyenv global 3.13.3
```

**Verify:**
```bash
python --version
```

Should show: `Python 3.13.3`

**That's it for installation!** ‚úÖ

You now have everything you need to build Django applications. We're using SQLite for the database (built into Python), so no database installation needed.

---

## üìö Your First Steps with Terminal

Before we dive into the project, let's learn basic terminal commands. Think of these as learning to walk before you run.

### Understanding Your File System

**Key concept**: Everything on your computer is organized in folders (also called "directories"). The terminal lets you navigate these folders using text commands.

**The filesystem tree:**
```
/                           (root - the top of everything)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Users
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourName           (your home directory)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Downloads
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Coding         (we'll create this)
```

### Essential Commands

Open Terminal and try these:

#### 1. `pwd` - Print Working Directory
**Shows where you are right now**

```bash
pwd
```

Output: `/Users/YourName` (your current location)

#### 2. `ls` - List
**Shows files and folders in current location**

```bash
ls
```

Output: `Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Pictures`

**See more details:**
```bash
ls -la
```

This shows hidden files, permissions, and sizes.

#### 3. `cd` - Change Directory
**Move to a different folder**

```bash
cd Desktop          # Go to Desktop
cd ..               # Go up one level (to parent folder)
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd /Users/YourName/Documents  # Go to specific path
```

**Practice:**
```bash
cd Desktop
pwd                 # Should show /Users/YourName/Desktop
cd ..
pwd                 # Should show /Users/YourName
```

#### 4. `mkdir` - Make Directory
**Create a new folder**

```bash
mkdir Coding
```

This creates a "Coding" folder in your current location.

#### 5. `cp` - Copy
**Copy files or folders**

```bash
cp file.txt backup.txt           # Copy a file
cp -r folder backup_folder       # Copy a folder (-r means recursive)
```

#### 6. `mv` - Move or Rename
**Move or rename files/folders**

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt       # Rename
mv file.txt Documents/           # Move to Documents folder
```

#### 7. `rm` - Remove
**Delete files or folders**

```bash
rm file.txt                      # Delete a file
rm -r folder                     # Delete a folder (-r means recursive)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: `rm` is permanent - there's no Trash/Recycle Bin!

### Practice Exercise

Let's create a practice project structure:

```bash
# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# Create a Coding folder
mkdir Coding

# Go into it
cd Coding

# Create a practice folder
mkdir practice

# Go into it
cd practice

# Create some files (the 'echo' command creates a file with text)
echo "Hello World" > test.txt

# See what's in the file
cat test.txt

# Create a folder structure
mkdir -p project/src/components

# See the structure
ls -R
```

**What each command did:**
- `mkdir -p` creates nested folders (creates all parents if needed)
- `echo "text" > file.txt` creates a file with that text
- `cat file.txt` shows the contents of a file
- `ls -R` lists everything recursively (shows subfolders too)

### Terminal Tips

**Shortcuts to save time:**
- `Tab` - Auto-complete (start typing a filename and press Tab)
- `‚Üë` (Up Arrow) - Shows previous command
- `Ctrl + C` - Stop a running command
- `Ctrl + A` - Go to beginning of line
- `Ctrl + E` - Go to end of line
- `Ctrl + U` - Clear entire line
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen

**Practice auto-complete:**
```bash
cd ~/Cod<TAB>       # Press Tab after typing 'Cod', it will complete to 'Coding'
```

---

## üöÄ Setting Up Your Django Project

Now we'll set up the actual project that will become your insurance tracker.

### Understanding the Template Factory üè≠

**Important concept:** This template works as a "factory" that creates new projects:

```
/Users/YourName/Coding/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildTemplate/          ‚Üê The factory (stays here forever)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup_new_project.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (template files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InsuranceTracker/       ‚Üê Created by the wizard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AnotherProject/         ‚Üê You can create as many as you want
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ThirdProject/           ‚Üê All created from the same template
```

The BuildTemplate folder stays permanently in one place and creates new projects as siblings. You never modify the BuildTemplate - it's your reusable factory!

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Coding Folder

```bash
cd ~/Coding
pwd                 # Verify you're in /Users/YourName/Coding
```

### Step 2: Clone the Template Factory from GitHub

We'll download (clone) the template factory from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the template factory
git clone https://github.com/cloudflying87/Django_template_build.git BuildTemplate

# Go into the template factory
cd BuildTemplate
```

**What just happened:**
- `git clone` downloaded the template factory from GitHub
- We named it "BuildTemplate" (this stays permanent)
- This folder contains the wizard that creates new projects

**What is cloning?** Think of it like downloading a zip file, but better:
- You get the entire project with all its history
- You can pull updates if the template improves
- Git tracks everything automatically

**For advanced users with SSH keys:**
If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub, you can use:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:cloudflying87/Django_template_build.git BuildTemplate
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you get "command not found: git", go back to Step 3 in the installation section
- If you get a permission error, make sure you're in a folder where you have write access (like ~/Coding)

### Step 3: Open BuildTemplate in VSCode

```bash
code .
```

**What this does**: Opens the BuildTemplate folder (`.` means "current folder") in VSCode.

**First time only**: If VSCode doesn't open, you may need to install the `code` command:
1. Open VSCode manually
2. Press `Command + Shift + P`
3. Type "shell command"
4. Click "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
5. Try `code .` again

**Note:** You're opening BuildTemplate to see the template files. Soon we'll run the wizard which will create your actual project in a new folder.

---

## üö¶ Choose Your Path

You now have everything set up and ready to go! There are **two ways** to proceed from here:

### üéØ Path A: Quick Start with Setup Wizard (Recommended for Beginners)

**This is the fastest way to get a working Django project!**

The BuildTemplate includes an interactive setup script (`setup_new_project.py`) that will:

‚úÖ **Walk you through design choices** - Pick your colors, style preferences, and features
‚úÖ **Create a complete Django project** - In a NEW folder (your actual project)
‚úÖ **Generate AI-ready documentation** - Custom files that help AI assistants understand your project
‚úÖ **Set up build scripts** - Automated deployment tools pre-configured
‚úÖ **Create custom CSS theme** - No Bootstrap/Tailwind - your own design system based on your choices
‚úÖ **Automatically open in VSCode** - Your new project opens in a new window

**How it works:**

The wizard will ask you friendly questions like:
- What do you want to name your project? (e.g., "insurance-tracker")
- What colors do you want for your project? (primary, secondary, accent)
- What design style? (professional, modern, friendly, technical)
- Do you want sharp corners or rounded edges?
- Should it have dark mode support?
- What special features do you need? (background tasks, caching, REST API)

Then it **automatically generates everything** in a NEW sibling directory: settings files, documentation, CSS theme, build scripts, and more. You'll have a complete project structure in minutes, ready to start building features immediately with AI assistance.

**To use the wizard:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the BuildTemplate directory
pwd    # Should show: /Users/YourName/Coding/BuildTemplate

# Run the setup wizard
python3 setup_new_project.py
```

**What the wizard does:**

When you run it, the wizard will:
1. Ask you questions (takes 5-10 minutes)
2. Show you a summary of your choices
3. Ask for confirmation
4. **Create your new project** in `/Users/YourName/Coding/InsuranceTracker/` (or whatever name you chose)
5. Offer to open the new project in a VSCode window (press Enter to accept)

**The result:**

```
/Users/YourName/Coding/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildTemplate/          ‚Üê Still here, untouched (for future projects)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InsuranceTracker/       ‚Üê Your NEW project (created by wizard)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md           ‚Üê Customized for your project
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT_SETUP_SUMMARY.md  ‚Üê Record of all your choices
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.sh
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (complete Django project structure)
```

**After using the wizard**, your InsuranceTracker project will have:
- A `CLAUDE.md` file customized for your project (AI assistants read this to understand your project)
- A `docs/` folder with complete guides
- A CSS theme with your chosen colors in `static/css/base.css`
- Pre-configured Docker files for production deployment
- A `build.sh` script for easy deployment
- A `PROJECT_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` with all your configuration details

**Important:** The BuildTemplate folder stays untouched, so you can use it again to create more projects later!

**Then you can start building immediately** by working with an AI assistant in your new InsuranceTracker project, creating your models, views, and templates!

---

### üìö Path B: Manual Setup (Learn Every Detail)

**Choose this if you want to understand every step of building a Django project from scratch.**

This path teaches you:
- How Django projects are structured
- What every file and folder does
- How to configure everything manually
- The fundamentals of web development

It takes longer, but you'll deeply understand how everything works.

**Continue to Step 4 below to follow the manual path.**

**üí° Recommendation:**

- **New to coding?** ‚Üí Use **Path A (Setup Wizard)** first to get a working project quickly, then explore the code and learn as you build features
- **Want to learn fundamentals?** ‚Üí Use **Path B (Manual Setup)** to understand every detail
- **Want both?** ‚Üí Start with Path A to see how a complete project looks, then create a second project with Path B to learn the details

---

### Step 4: Explore the Project in VSCode

**üìç Where you should be now:**

- **If you used Path A (Setup Wizard):**
  - The wizard offered to open VSCode automatically - you should now see your new project (e.g., InsuranceTracker) open in a new VSCode window
  - If you said "no" to the auto-open, run: `code ../InsuranceTracker` (or your project name)

- **If you're following Path B (Manual Setup):**
  - You should still be in the BuildTemplate folder
  - You'll need to manually create your project structure (continue reading below)

**For Path A users:** In VSCode, you'll see a sidebar with folders. This is your project structure. Let me explain what each folder does:

```
InsuranceTracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/                  # Where your Django apps live (we'll create 'insurance' here)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                 # Build scripts for deployment (advanced - ignore for now)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/               # Django project settings (will be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/              # CSS, JavaScript, images
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/            # Your custom styles
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/             # JavaScript files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/         # Images for your site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/          # HTML templates for your pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example        # Example environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Python packages needed (will be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.sqlite3         # Your database file (will be created)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py          # Django's command-line tool (will be created)
```

**Don't worry if some of these don't exist yet!** We'll create them as we go. The template provides the basic structure.

### Step 5: Create a Python Virtual Environment

**What is a virtual environment?**
Think of it as a separate workspace for this project's tools. Just like you might have separate toolboxes for different hobbies (one for woodworking, one for electronics), a virtual environment keeps this project's Python packages separate from other projects.

**Why do we need this?**
- Project A might need Django version 4.0
- Project B might need Django version 5.0
- Without virtual environments, you'd have constant conflicts
- With virtual environments, each project has its own isolated set of packages

**Let's create one:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder
cd ~/Coding/InsuranceTracker

# Create a virtual environment named 'insurance-tracker' using Python 3.13.3
pyenv virtualenv 3.13.3 insurance-tracker

# Activate it for this folder
pyenv local insurance-tracker
```

**What each command does:**

1. **`pyenv virtualenv 3.13.3 insurance-tracker`**
   - Creates a new virtual environment
   - Uses Python version 3.13.3
   - Names it "insurance-tracker"
   - This is like creating a new toolbox

2. **`pyenv local insurance-tracker`**
   - Creates a `.python-version` file in your folder
   - This file tells pyenv "whenever I'm in this folder, use the insurance-tracker environment"
   - It's automatic from now on - every time you `cd` into this folder, the right environment activates

**Verify it's active:**
```bash
python --version    # Should show Python 3.13.3
which python        # Should show a path with 'insurance-tracker' in it
```

**What you should see:**
```
Python 3.13.3
/Users/YourName/.pyenv/versions/insurance-tracker/bin/python
```

The path shows "insurance-tracker" - that means you're using the right environment!

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `python --version` shows a different version, try closing and reopening your terminal
- Make sure you're in the InsuranceTracker folder (`pwd` to check)
- If it still doesn't work, run `pyenv local insurance-tracker` again

### Step 6: Install Django and Essential Packages

First, let's create a `requirements.txt` file that lists what packages we need:

**In VSCode:**
1. Click "New File" icon in the left sidebar (or press `Command + N`)
2. Paste this content:

```txt
Django==5.0.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
pillow==10.2.0
```

3. Save as `requirements.txt` in the root folder (File ‚Üí Save, or `Command + S`)

**What each package does:**

- **`Django==5.0.1`** - The web framework itself
  - This is the main package that provides everything (models, views, templates, admin, etc.)
  - The `==5.0.1` means "install exactly version 5.0.1" (ensures consistency)

- **`python-dotenv==1.0.0`** - Loads environment variables from `.env` file
  - Lets you store secrets (passwords, API keys) in a file that's not committed to Git
  - Example: instead of hardcoding your email password in code, you store it in `.env`

- **`pillow==10.2.0`** - Handles image uploads
  - Useful for uploading photos of receipts or EOB documents
  - Django needs this for ImageField and processing images

**Notice what we DON'T need:**
- No PostgreSQL driver (we're using SQLite, which is built into Python)
- No Redis or Celery (not needed for a simple tracker)
- Just 3 packages! Keeping it simple.

**Install these packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this does:**
- `pip` is Python's package installer (like an app store)
- `-r requirements.txt` means "read the list from this file"
- It downloads and installs each package and their dependencies

This takes 1-2 minutes. You'll see lots of output - that's normal!

**Verify Django is installed:**
```bash
django-admin --version
```

Should show: `5.0.1`

If you see `5.0.1`, you're good to go! ‚úÖ

### Step 7: Create the Django Project

```bash
# Create the project configuration
django-admin startproject config .
```

**Important**: Note the `.` at the end! This means "create the project in the current folder" rather than creating a new subfolder.

**What this created:**
```
config/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py          # Makes this a Python package
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py          # Main Django settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.py              # URL routing configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asgi.py              # Async server config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgi.py              # Web server config
manage.py                # Django management command tool
```

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
python manage.py --version
```

Should show: `5.0.1`

### Step 8: Create Your First Django App (Insurance Tracker)

Django projects are organized into "apps". Each app handles a specific feature. We'll create an app for our insurance tracking.

```bash
# Create the app
python manage.py startapp insurance

# Move it into the apps/ folder (better organization)
mv insurance apps/
```

**What this created:**
```
apps/insurance/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.py           # Register models for admin interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.py            # App configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py          # Database models (we'll define EOB data here)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests.py           # Write tests here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views.py           # Handle web requests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/        # Database change history
```

### Step 9: Configure Django Settings

We need to tell Django about our new app and configure file storage for uploads.

**Open** `config/settings.py` in VSCode.

This file contains all of Django's configuration. Let's make a few changes:

#### A. Register Your Insurance App

**Find the `INSTALLED_APPS` list** (around line 33) and add your app:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'apps.insurance',           # Add this line
]
```

**What this does:**
- Tells Django "this app exists and should be included"
- Django will now look for models, templates, and views in this app
- The admin interface will be able to find your models

**Why `apps.insurance`?**
- Because we moved the `insurance` folder into `apps/`
- The dot notation means "inside the apps folder, find insurance"
- If we hadn't moved it, we'd just write `'insurance'`

#### B. Check the Database Configuration

**Scroll down to the `DATABASES` section** (around line 75).

You should see something like this:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

**Don't change this!** This is Django's default, and it's perfect for learning.

**What this means:**
- **`ENGINE`** - Which database system to use (SQLite in this case)
- **`NAME`** - Where to store the database file
  - `BASE_DIR` is your project root folder
  - `/` joins paths (works on Mac, Windows, Linux)
  - This creates a file called `db.sqlite3` in your project root

**Why SQLite is great for beginners:**
- No installation needed (built into Python)
- Just a single file - easy to understand
- Easy to delete and start over (just delete the file)
- Fast enough for thousands of records
- When you're ready, switching to PostgreSQL is just changing these 4 lines

#### C. Configure Static and Media Files

**Find `STATIC_URL`** (around line 117) and add these lines after it:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
]
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

**What these settings do:**

- **`STATIC_URL = '/static/'`**
  - The URL prefix for static files (CSS, JavaScript, images that are part of your site design)
  - Example: A CSS file at `static/css/style.css` will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/static/css/style.css`

- **`STATICFILES_DIRS`**
  - List of folders where Django should look for static files during development
  - We're telling it to look in the `static/` folder in our project root

- **`STATIC_ROOT`**
  - Where to collect ALL static files when deploying to production
  - The `python manage.py collectstatic` command copies everything here
  - Not used during development

- **`MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`**
  - The URL prefix for user-uploaded files (EOB documents, photos, etc.)
  - Example: An uploaded file will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/media/eob_documents/file.pdf`

- **`MEDIA_ROOT`**
  - Where to actually store uploaded files on your hard drive
  - Creates a `media/` folder in your project root

**The difference between STATIC and MEDIA:**
- **STATIC** = Files you create (your CSS, your JavaScript, your logo)
- **MEDIA** = Files users upload (EOB PDFs, receipt photos)

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

Your Django settings are now configured! ‚úÖ

### Step 10: Create the Database Schema

Now we'll create the database tables Django needs:

```bash
# Create migrations (Django analyzes your models and creates database instructions)
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations (Actually creates the database tables)
python manage.py migrate
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  ...
```

This created tables for user authentication, sessions, and admin interface.

### Step 11: Create a Superuser (Admin Account)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**You'll be prompted for:**
- Username: (enter anything, like `admin`)
- Email: (enter your email or press Enter to skip)
- Password: (enter a password - you won't see it as you type)
- Password (again): (confirm)

**Remember these credentials!** You'll use them to log into the admin interface.

### Step 12: Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
January 01, 2025 - 12:00:00
Django version 5.0.1, using settings 'config.settings'

Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

**Open your browser** and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should see the Django welcome page! üéâ

**Try the admin interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Log in with your superuser credentials.

**To stop the server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## üí≥ Building the Insurance Tracker

Now let's build the actual insurance tracking functionality!

### Understanding the Data Model

Before we code, let's think about what data we need to track:

**For the Insurance Policy:**
- Deductible amount (e.g., $2,000)
- Deductible period (annual, per-incident, etc.)
- Current year
- Policy holder name

**For Each EOB Entry:**
- Date of service
- Provider name (doctor, hospital, etc.)
- Service category (office visit, lab work, prescription, etc.)
- Billed amount (what provider charged)
- Insurance paid amount
- You owe amount
- Applied to deductible amount
- Status (pending, paid, etc.)
- Notes
- Uploaded EOB document (PDF or image)

### Step 1: Define the Database Models

**Open** `apps/insurance/models.py` in VSCode.

**Replace the entire file with:**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone


class InsurancePolicy(models.Model):
    """Represents an insurance policy with deductible tracking"""

    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    policy_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, help_text="e.g., 'Blue Cross 2025'")
    deductible_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, help_text="Annual deductible")
    deductible_period = models.CharField(
        max_length=50,
        choices=[
            ('annual', 'Annual'),
            ('per_incident', 'Per Incident'),
            ('lifetime', 'Lifetime'),
        ],
        default='annual'
    )
    year = models.IntegerField(default=timezone.now().year)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-year', '-created_at']

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.policy_name} - {self.year}"

    def total_spent(self):
        """Calculate total amount applied to deductible"""
        return self.eob_entries.aggregate(
            total=models.Sum('applied_to_deductible')
        )['total'] or 0

    def remaining_deductible(self):
        """Calculate remaining deductible amount"""
        return max(0, self.deductible_amount - self.total_spent())

    def deductible_met_percentage(self):
        """Calculate percentage of deductible met"""
        if self.deductible_amount == 0:
            return 0
        return min(100, (self.total_spent() / self.deductible_amount) * 100)


class ServiceCategory(models.Model):
    """Categories for medical services"""

    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    color = models.CharField(max_length=7, default='#3B82F6', help_text="Hex color for charts")

    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = 'Service Categories'
        ordering = ['name']

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class EOBEntry(models.Model):
    """Explanation of Benefits entry"""

    policy = models.ForeignKey(InsurancePolicy, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='eob_entries')

    # Service details
    date_of_service = models.DateField()
    provider_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    category = models.ForeignKey(ServiceCategory, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    service_description = models.TextField(blank=True)

    # Financial details
    billed_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, help_text="Amount provider charged")
    insurance_paid = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, help_text="Amount insurance paid")
    patient_owed = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, help_text="Amount you owe")
    applied_to_deductible = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, help_text="Amount applied to deductible")

    # Status and tracking
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[
            ('pending', 'Pending'),
            ('paid', 'Paid'),
            ('partially_paid', 'Partially Paid'),
            ('disputed', 'Disputed'),
        ],
        default='pending'
    )

    payment_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)

    # File upload
    eob_document = models.FileField(upload_to='eob_documents/', null=True, blank=True)

    # Timestamps
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'EOB Entry'
        verbose_name_plural = 'EOB Entries'
        ordering = ['-date_of_service', '-created_at']

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.provider_name} - {self.date_of_service} (${self.patient_owed})"
```

**What this code does:**

1. **InsurancePolicy model**: Stores policy information and calculates deductible progress
   - `total_spent()` - Adds up all EOB entries
   - `remaining_deductible()` - Shows how much left to pay
   - `deductible_met_percentage()` - For progress bars

2. **ServiceCategory model**: Categories like "Office Visit", "Lab Work", etc.

3. **EOBEntry model**: Each individual EOB with all financial details

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

### Step 2: Create and Apply Migrations

```bash
# Create migration files based on our new models
python manage.py makemigrations insurance

# Apply the migrations to create database tables
python manage.py migrate insurance
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Migrations for 'insurance':
  apps/insurance/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model InsurancePolicy
    - Create model ServiceCategory
    - Create model EOBEntry
```

### Step 3: Register Models in Admin Interface

**Open** `apps/insurance/admin.py` in VSCode.

**Replace the entire file with:**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import InsurancePolicy, ServiceCategory, EOBEntry


@admin.register(ServiceCategory)
class ServiceCategoryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['name', 'description', 'color']
    search_fields = ['name']


@admin.register(InsurancePolicy)
class InsurancePolicyAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['policy_name', 'year', 'deductible_amount', 'get_total_spent', 'get_remaining']
    list_filter = ['year']
    search_fields = ['policy_name', 'user__username']

    def get_total_spent(self, obj):
        return f"${obj.total_spent():,.2f}"
    get_total_spent.short_description = 'Total Spent'

    def get_remaining(self, obj):
        return f"${obj.remaining_deductible():,.2f}"
    get_remaining.short_description = 'Remaining'


@admin.register(EOBEntry)
class EOBEntryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = [
        'date_of_service',
        'provider_name',
        'category',
        'patient_owed',
        'applied_to_deductible',
        'status'
    ]
    list_filter = ['status', 'category', 'date_of_service']
    search_fields = ['provider_name', 'service_description']
    date_hierarchy = 'date_of_service'

    fieldsets = (
        ('Service Information', {
            'fields': ('policy', 'date_of_service', 'provider_name', 'category', 'service_description')
        }),
        ('Financial Details', {
            'fields': ('billed_amount', 'insurance_paid', 'patient_owed', 'applied_to_deductible')
        }),
        ('Status & Payment', {
            'fields': ('status', 'payment_date', 'notes')
        }),
        ('Documents', {
            'fields': ('eob_document',)
        }),
    )
```

**What this does:**
- Registers our models so they appear in the admin interface
- Customizes how data is displayed
- Adds filters and search functionality
- Organizes fields into logical sections

**Save the file** (`Command + S`)

### Step 4: Add Sample Data

Let's add some sample categories and a test policy.

**Start the development server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Go to the admin interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

**Log in** with your superuser credentials.

**Add Service Categories:**
1. Click "Service Categories" ‚Üí "Add Service Category"
2. Add these categories one by one:
   - Name: "Office Visit", Color: `#3B82F6` (blue)
   - Name: "Lab Work", Color: `#10B981` (green)
   - Name: "Prescription", Color: `#F59E0B` (amber)
   - Name: "Imaging (X-Ray, MRI)", Color: `#8B5CF6` (purple)
   - Name: "Emergency Room", Color: `#EF4444` (red)
   - Name: "Surgery", Color: `#EC4899` (pink)
   - Name: "Physical Therapy", Color: `#06B6D4` (cyan)

**Add an Insurance Policy:**
1. Click "Insurance Policies" ‚Üí "Add Insurance Policy"
2. Fill in:
   - User: Select your username
   - Policy name: "My Health Insurance 2025"
   - Deductible amount: 2000
   - Deductible period: Annual
   - Year: 2025
3. Click "Save"

**Add Sample EOB Entries:**
1. Click "EOB Entries" ‚Üí "Add EOB Entry"
2. Example 1:
   - Policy: Select the policy you just created
   - Date of service: Pick a recent date
   - Provider name: "Dr. Smith - Family Practice"
   - Category: Office Visit
   - Service description: "Annual checkup"
   - Billed amount: 250
   - Insurance paid: 200
   - Patient owed: 50
   - Applied to deductible: 50
   - Status: Paid
3. Click "Save and add another"
4. Add a few more entries with different categories and amounts

### Step 5: Create a Simple Dashboard View

Now let's create a web page to view this data (instead of just using the admin).

**Open** `apps/insurance/views.py` in VSCode.

**Replace with:**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.db.models import Sum
from .models import InsurancePolicy, EOBEntry, ServiceCategory


@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    """Main dashboard showing all policies"""
    policies = InsurancePolicy.objects.filter(user=request.user)

    context = {
        'policies': policies,
    }
    return render(request, 'insurance/dashboard.html', context)


@login_required
def policy_detail(request, policy_id):
    """Detailed view of a single policy with all EOB entries"""
    policy = get_object_or_404(InsurancePolicy, id=policy_id, user=request.user)

    # Get all EOB entries for this policy
    eob_entries = policy.eob_entries.all()

    # Calculate spending by category
    category_spending = eob_entries.values('category__name', 'category__color').annotate(
        total=Sum('applied_to_deductible')
    ).order_by('-total')

    context = {
        'policy': policy,
        'eob_entries': eob_entries,
        'category_spending': category_spending,
        'total_entries': eob_entries.count(),
    }
    return render(request, 'insurance/policy_detail.html', context)
```

### Step 6: Configure URLs

**Create a new file**: `apps/insurance/urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'insurance'

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
    path('policy/<int:policy_id>/', views.policy_detail, name='policy_detail'),
]
```

**Open** `config/urls.py` and modify it to include our app's URLs:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('apps.insurance.urls')),  # Add this line
]

# Serve media files in development
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

### Step 7: Create HTML Templates

**Create the template directories:**
```bash
mkdir -p templates/insurance
```

**Create** `templates/base.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

## ü§ñ Working with AI Assistants

Now that you have a working foundation, here's how to use AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to build features faster.

### Understanding What AI Assistants Can Do

**AI assistants excel at:**
- Writing boilerplate code
- Explaining existing code
- Debugging errors
- Suggesting implementations
- Creating HTML/CSS layouts
- Writing database queries
- Generating test data

**AI assistants struggle with:**
- Understanding your specific business logic (you need to explain it)
- Knowing your exact file structure (you need to show them)
- Making subjective design decisions (you need to decide)
- Complex debugging across multiple files

### Choosing the Right AI Model for Django Development

Not all AI models are created equal for coding tasks. Here's an honest comparison to help you choose:

#### **Understanding Context Windows and Tokens**

Before we compare models, let's understand what these technical terms mean:

**What is a token?**
- A "token" is roughly a word, part of a word, or a piece of code
- Examples:
  - "Hello" = 1 token
  - "Django" = 1 token
  - "def calculate_total():" = about 6 tokens
  - Your entire `models.py` file = maybe 1,000-3,000 tokens

**Rule of thumb:**
- 1 token ‚âà 4 characters of text
- 100 tokens ‚âà 75 words
- 1,000 tokens ‚âà 750 words or ~50 lines of code

**What is a context window?**
Think of it as the AI's "working memory" - how much text it can see and remember at once.

**Analogy:** Imagine you're editing a book:
- **Small context (4K tokens):** You can only see 1 page at a time
- **Medium context (16K tokens):** You can see 1 chapter
- **Large context (128K tokens):** You can see 5-10 chapters
- **Huge context (200K tokens):** You can see the entire book plus notes

**Why this matters for Django:**

**Example 1: Debugging an error**
```
Small context (GPT-3.5 - 4K tokens):
- Can see: Just the error message and one function
- Problem: Doesn't know what's in your models.py or settings.py
- Result: Generic advice that might not apply

Large context (Claude - 200K tokens):
- Can see: Error + models.py + views.py + settings.py + templates
- Understands: Full picture of your app
- Result: Specific fix that considers your entire setup
```

**Example 2: Your Insurance Tracker**

Your project files:
- `models.py` (EOB models) = ~2,000 tokens
- `views.py` = ~1,500 tokens
- `admin.py` = ~800 tokens
- `settings.py` = ~1,000 tokens
- `urls.py` = ~500 tokens
- **Total: ~6,000 tokens**

**With small context (4K tokens):**
- You can only show the AI one file at a time
- AI doesn't know how files connect
- You have to explain relationships manually

**With large context (200K tokens):**
- Show AI your entire project at once
- AI understands how models, views, and templates work together
- Get better, more integrated suggestions

**Practical example:**

**You ask:** "Why is my EOBEntry not saving the category?"

**Small context AI:**
- Sees only the model definition
- Says: "The code looks fine, make sure you're setting the category field"
- Doesn't help much

**Large context AI:**
- Sees models.py, views.py, and your form
- Says: "In your `policy_detail` view on line 23, you're creating the EOBEntry but not including the category in the form data. Add `category=request.POST.get('category')` to line 25."
- Actually solves the problem!

**The bottom line:**
- **Bigger context = AI sees more of your code = better answers**
- For learning Django, aim for at least 100K token context
- This is why Claude (200K) and GPT-4 (128K) are recommended
- Avoid older models with tiny context windows (you'll spend time explaining instead of building)

---

#### **Best for Django/Python Projects**

**1. Claude (Anthropic) - Sonnet 3.5 or Opus**
- ‚úÖ **Best for:** Complex Django projects, debugging, refactoring
- ‚úÖ **Context window:** 200K tokens (can see your entire codebase)
- ‚úÖ **Code quality:** Excellent at following Django best practices
- ‚úÖ **Explaining code:** Great at breaking down complex concepts for beginners
- ‚úÖ **Multi-file changes:** Can work across multiple files coherently
- ‚úÖ **Up-to-date:** Trained on recent Django/Python versions
- ‚ùå **Limitation:** May be more verbose (explains a lot)

**Why it's best for this project:**
- Can see your entire `models.py`, `views.py`, `settings.py` at once
- Understands Django ORM deeply (queries, relationships, migrations)
- Great at explaining *why* something works, not just *how*
- Excellent for learning because it teaches as it codes

**2. GPT-4 / GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)**
- ‚úÖ **Best for:** Quick code snippets, general programming questions
- ‚úÖ **Context window:** 128K tokens (good for most files)
- ‚úÖ **Code quality:** Very good, widely used
- ‚úÖ **Speed:** Fast responses
- ‚úÖ **Integrations:** Works with many tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot Chat)
- ‚ùå **Django specifics:** Sometimes suggests outdated patterns
- ‚ùå **Explanation depth:** More concise (less teaching)

**When to use:**
- Quick "how do I do X in Django?" questions
- When you need a fast answer
- When working in an IDE with GPT-4 integration

**3. Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)**
- ‚úÖ **Context window:** 1-2 million tokens (can see massive codebases)
- ‚úÖ **Best for:** Analyzing large projects, documentation
- ‚ùå **Code quality:** Good but sometimes generic
- ‚ùå **Django expertise:** Less specialized in Django compared to Claude/GPT-4

**When to use:**
- You need to analyze an entire large codebase at once
- Reading and understanding documentation
- Summarizing lots of code

#### **Models That Fall Short for Django**

**GPT-3.5**
- ‚ùå Outdated Django patterns
- ‚ùå Smaller context window (can't see enough code)
- ‚ùå Makes more mistakes with modern Django features
- ‚ùå Less helpful explanations
- **Verdict:** Skip it. The newer models are worth the cost/effort.

**GitHub Copilot (base)**
- ‚úÖ Great for autocomplete while typing
- ‚ùå Not conversational (can't ask questions)
- ‚ùå Limited context (only sees current file)
- ‚ùå Can't explain why or debug
- **Verdict:** Use alongside a chat model, not as replacement

**Local Models (Llama, Mistral, CodeLlama)**
- ‚úÖ Privacy (runs on your computer)
- ‚úÖ Free
- ‚ùå Smaller context windows
- ‚ùå Less accurate for Django-specific questions
- ‚ùå Slower on most hardware
- **Verdict:** Great for privacy-sensitive work, but harder for beginners

**Older Models (ChatGPT 3.5, Bard)**
- ‚ùå Outdated training data
- ‚ùå Suggest deprecated Django patterns
- ‚ùå More errors, more time debugging
- **Verdict:** Avoid. Using old models is like learning from a 2018 Django tutorial in 2025.

#### **Practical Recommendations**

**For this insurance tracker project:**

**Best setup:**
1. **Primary:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 or GPT-4 for development questions
2. **Secondary:** GitHub Copilot in VSCode for autocomplete
3. **Backup:** Keep both Claude and GPT-4 available - sometimes one explains better than the other

**For different tasks:**

| Task | Best Model | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| **Learning Django** | Claude Sonnet | Explains concepts deeply |
| **Quick syntax** | GPT-4 | Fast, accurate |
| **Debugging errors** | Claude Sonnet | Better at reasoning through complex issues |
| **Code review** | Claude Opus | Most thorough analysis |
| **Writing tests** | Either Claude or GPT-4 | Both excellent |
| **Database queries** | Claude Sonnet | Deep ORM understanding |
| **CSS/HTML** | Either works well | Less specialized knowledge needed |
| **Deployment** | Claude Sonnet | Better at DevOps reasoning |

#### **How to Access These Models**

**Claude:**
- Web: https://claude.ai (free tier available)
- API: https://console.anthropic.com
- IDE: Use with Cursor or Claude Code

**GPT-4:**
- Web: https://chat.openai.com (ChatGPT Plus - $20/month)
- API: https://platform.openai.com
- IDE: GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor

**Cost Considerations:**
- **Free tier:** Claude has a generous free tier, GPT-4 via ChatGPT Plus
- **API pay-as-you-go:** Usually $0.50-$5 per month for hobby projects
- **Worth it?** Absolutely. The time saved pays for itself in the first hour.

#### **The Bottom Line**

**For absolute beginners learning Django:**
‚Üí **Use Claude Sonnet 3.5 as your primary assistant**

**Why?**
1. It can see your entire project at once (200K context)
2. It explains *why*, not just *what* (better for learning)
3. Understands Django deeply (fewer outdated suggestions)
4. Patient with beginners (good at explaining concepts)
5. Great at catching mistakes before they become bugs

**For experienced developers:**
‚Üí **Use GPT-4 for speed, Claude for complex problems**

**Avoid:**
- GPT-3.5 (outdated)
- Free/older models for learning (you'll learn wrong patterns)
- Any model that can't see at least 50K tokens (too little context)

**Pro tip:** Ask the same complex question to both Claude and GPT-4, compare answers. You'll quickly learn which one you prefer for different tasks.

### How to Ask Effective Questions

**‚ùå Bad request:**
"Make my site better"

**‚úÖ Good request:**
"I want to add a feature where users can upload a PDF of their EOB document. The PDF should be stored with the EOBEntry model and displayed as a download link in the policy detail page. Can you help me implement this?"

**Why it's better:**
- Specific feature described
- Clear acceptance criteria (upload PDF, store it, show download link)
- Mentioned relevant model (EOBEntry)

### Example Feature Requests for Your Insurance Tracker

#### Feature 1: PDF Upload and Preview

**Request to AI:**
```
I need to add PDF upload functionality to my EOB entries. Here's what I need:

1. In the admin interface, add a file upload field for EOBEntry
2. Store PDFs in a 'eob_documents/' folder
3. On the policy detail page, show a "View EOB" link for each entry that has a PDF
4. When clicked, open the PDF in a new tab

My EOBEntry model already has an `eob_document` FileField. I just need help with:
- Configuring media file serving in development
- Adding the download link to the template
```

#### Feature 2: Monthly Spending Chart

**Request to AI:**
```
I want to add a simple bar chart showing spending by month for the current year.

Requirements:
- Show on the policy detail page
- Use Chart.js (or suggest a simple alternative)
- X-axis: Months (Jan-Dec)
- Y-axis: Amount applied to deductible
- Use data from EOBEntry.date_of_service and EOBEntry.applied_to_deductible

Can you provide:
1. The Django view code to aggregate monthly spending
2. The template code with Chart.js
3. CDN link for Chart.js
```

#### Feature 3: Email Notifications

**Request to AI:**
```
I want to send an email notification when the user reaches 80% of their deductible.

Requirements:
- Check in the EOBEntry save method
- Only send once per policy per year
- Use Django's built-in email functionality
- Email should include: policy name, total spent, remaining amount

Can you show me:
1. How to override the save() method on EOBEntry
2. How to check if we've already sent the notification (maybe add a field to InsurancePolicy?)
3. Sample email configuration for Gmail SMTP
```

### Working Through Errors with AI

When you get an error, provide:

1. **The full error message** (copy from terminal)
2. **What you were trying to do**
3. **The relevant code** (the file and function where error occurred)

**Example:**

```
I'm getting this error when trying to view the policy detail page:

```
TemplateDoesNotExist at /policy/1/
insurance/policy_detail.html
```

I created the file at templates/insurance/policy_detail.html but Django can't find it.

Here's my settings.py TEMPLATES configuration:
[paste your TEMPLATES setting]

What am I missing?
```

### Iterating on Features

**Start small, then enhance:**

1. **Version 1**: Simple table of EOB entries
2. **Version 2**: Add filtering by category
3. **Version 3**: Add date range filtering
4. **Version 4**: Add export to CSV
5. **Version 5**: Add visual charts

Ask AI to help with one version at a time. Test each version before moving to the next.

### Learning from AI-Generated Code

**Don't just copy-paste. Understand it:**

When AI gives you code, ask follow-up questions:
- "What does this line do?"
- "Why did you use a ForeignKey instead of a CharField here?"
- "What's the difference between `filter()` and `get()`?"
- "Can you explain this list comprehension in simpler terms?"

**Example conversation:**

**You:** [Paste AI-generated code]

**You:** "Can you explain what `aggregate(total=Sum('applied_to_deductible'))` does line by line?"

**AI:** "Sure! This is a Django ORM method that performs a database aggregation:
- `aggregate()` - Tells Django to calculate a summary value across multiple rows
- `total=` - Names the result 'total' so you can access it as `result['total']`
- `Sum('applied_to_deductible')` - Adds up all values in the 'applied_to_deductible' column
- This generates SQL like: SELECT SUM(applied_to_deductible) AS total FROM ..."

### Example AI Conversation for Your Next Feature

Let's say you want to add a "Quick Add EOB" form on the dashboard:

**You:**
"I want to add a simple form on the dashboard page that lets me quickly add an EOB entry without going to the admin. The form should have:
- Date of service (date picker)
- Provider name (text input)
- Category (dropdown)
- Amount applied to deductible (number input)
- Submit button

When submitted, it should create a new EOBEntry and refresh the page. Can you help me implement this with Django forms?"

**AI provides**: Form class, view modification, template HTML

**You test it**

**You:**
"It works! But I want to add client-side validation so the deductible amount can't be negative. How do I add that?"

**AI provides**: HTML5 validation attributes or JavaScript validation

**You:**
"Perfect! One more thing - can the form automatically set the policy to the user's most recent policy instead of showing a dropdown?"

**AI provides**: View modification to auto-set policy

**Keep iterating until perfect!**

## üéâ You Did It!

You now have a fully functional Django project and the knowledge to keep building. The insurance tracker is just the beginning - you can apply these same concepts to any idea you have.

**What you learned:**
- ‚úÖ Development environment setup
- ‚úÖ Terminal navigation
- ‚úÖ Git version control
- ‚úÖ Django models, views, templates
- ‚úÖ Database design
- ‚úÖ Admin customization
- ‚úÖ HTML/CSS basics
- ‚úÖ Working with AI assistants

**Your next project could be:**
- Personal finance tracker
- Recipe manager
- Habit tracker
- Book library
- Workout log
- Project management tool
- Anything you can imagine!

The skills you learned today transfer to any web project. Keep building, keep learning, and most importantly - have fun!

---

## üè≠ Creating More Projects

**Remember:** You still have the BuildTemplate factory! You can create unlimited Django projects from it.

### To Create Your Next Project:

```bash
# Navigate to BuildTemplate
cd ~/Coding/BuildTemplate

# Run the wizard again
python3 setup_new_project.py

# Answer the questions for your new project
# (e.g., name it "recipe-manager", choose different colors, etc.)
```

The wizard will create another sibling project:

```
/Users/YourName/Coding/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildTemplate/          ‚Üê The factory (still here!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InsuranceTracker/       ‚Üê Your first project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RecipeManager/          ‚Üê Your new project
```

### Each Project is Independent

- Different Python virtual environment
- Different database
- Different settings, colors, features
- Different Git repository
- All built from the same proven template

**Tip:** Keep the BuildTemplate folder and never modify it. It's your reusable factory for all future Django projects!

## üóÑÔ∏è When Should I Upgrade to PostgreSQL?

You might wonder: "When do I switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL?" Here's an honest answer.

### SQLite is Sufficient For

- **Personal projects** (just you using it)
- **Small team apps** (2-5 people, not using it constantly)
- **Development and testing** (always use SQLite locally)
- **Moderate data** (up to 100,000 records is totally fine)
- **Learning** (focus on Django, not database administration)

**Real talk:** Your insurance tracker will likely never outgrow SQLite. Unless you're tracking insurance for an entire company, SQLite is perfect.

### Upgrade to PostgreSQL When

**You have these specific problems:**

1. **Many concurrent users** (20+ people writing to database simultaneously)
   - SQLite locks the entire database during writes
   - PostgreSQL handles concurrent writes gracefully

2. **Large datasets** (millions of records)
   - SQLite slows down on complex queries over huge datasets
   - PostgreSQL is optimized for big data

3. **Advanced features needed**
   - Full-text search across multiple columns
   - Complex JSON queries
   - Stored procedures
   - Row-level locking

4. **Production deployment requirements**
   - Many hosting platforms prefer PostgreSQL
   - Better backup and replication tools
   - Industry standard for production Django apps

### How to Upgrade (When You're Ready)

Switching is actually simple! Here's what changes:

**1. Install PostgreSQL** (one-time setup)
```bash
# Mac
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16

# Or use Docker for easier management
docker run -d \
  --name postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=insurance_tracker \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16
```

**2. Install the PostgreSQL adapter**
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

**3. Update settings.py** (just 8 lines)
```python
# Change this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}

# To this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'insurance_tracker',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'postgres',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

**4. Run migrations again**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

That's it! Your code doesn't change at all. Django handles the differences.

### My Recommendation

**Start with SQLite. Don't even think about PostgreSQL until:**
- You have a specific problem SQLite can't solve
- You're deploying to production with real users
- You're 6+ months into your project and actually experiencing performance issues

**Why?**
- One less thing to install and manage
- One less thing to break
- More time focusing on building your actual app
- When you do need PostgreSQL, switching takes 10 minutes

Instagram started with SQLite. Stack Overflow started with SQLite. You're in good company.

**Focus on building, not infrastructure.**

## ü§î "Wait, Should I Use Flask Instead?"

You might hear people say "Flask is simpler for beginners." Let's have an honest conversation about this.

### The "Flask is Simpler" Myth

People say Flask is simpler, and that's... **half true**:

**Flask Hello World:**
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello World"
```

**Django Hello World:**
```python
# Needs settings.py, urls.py, views.py, etc.
# More files, more structure
```

Flask **looks** simpler initially. But once you need:
- Database models ‚Üí Install SQLAlchemy, configure it
- User login ‚Üí Install Flask-Login, set up sessions
- Forms ‚Üí Install Flask-WTF, configure CSRF
- File uploads ‚Üí Configure upload folders, validation
- Admin panel ‚Üí Install Flask-Admin, configure every model

Suddenly you're Googling "Flask best practices" and getting 10 different answers.

### Django vs Flask for This Project

**For the insurance EOB tracker specifically:**

| Feature | Django | Flask |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Time to working app** | 30 minutes | 3-4 hours |
| **Lines of code** | ~200 | ~500+ |
| **Admin interface** | Free, automatic | Build it yourself |
| **User authentication** | Built-in | Install + configure extension |
| **Database migrations** | Built-in | Install Alembic, configure |
| **Form validation** | Built-in | Install Flask-WTF |
| **File uploads** | Configured | Configure manually |
| **Security (CSRF, XSS)** | Enabled by default | Configure yourself |

### Django Advantages for This Project

**1. Admin Interface (Huge Time Saver)**
- Django: Free, automatic admin panel to manage data
- Flask: You'd need to build every form, table, and CRUD interface manually

**2. Less Code to Write**
- Django EOB tracker: ~200 lines of Python
- Flask equivalent: ~500+ lines (need to add Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, etc.)

**3. Fewer Decisions**
- Django: "There's one obvious way" - just follow the structure
- Flask: "Should I use SQLAlchemy or Peewee? WTForms or Flask-WTF? Jinja templates where?" = decision fatigue

**4. Better for Learning Full-Stack Concepts**
- Django teaches you how complete web apps work as a system
- Flask teaches you Python fundamentals, but you'll need to learn how to connect the pieces

### When Flask Is Actually Better

**Flask shines for:**
- Simple APIs (just a few endpoints)
- Learning Python basics first (less "magic")
- Microservices
- When you want maximum control
- Very simple single-page apps
- When you already know web development and want lightweight

### Where Beginners Get Stuck

**Django beginners struggle with:**
- "What's a migration?" (but you'll learn this quickly)
- "Where does this file go?" (but the structure prevents chaos later)
- "Why so much boilerplate?" (but it's solving problems you don't know you have yet)

**Flask beginners struggle with:**
- "Which packages should I use?" (analysis paralysis)
- "How do I structure this?" (everyone's app looks different)
- "Why isn't this working?" (misconfigured extensions)
- "How do I add user accounts?" (watch a 2-hour tutorial)
- "Did I configure security correctly?" (easy to make mistakes)

### The Uncomfortable Truth

For your insurance tracker, Flask would mean:
- ‚úÖ More control over every detail
- ‚úÖ Less "magic" happening behind the scenes
- ‚úÖ Lighter weight (fewer dependencies)
- ‚ùå 3-4x more code to write
- ‚ùå More security mistakes possible
- ‚ùå No admin interface (you'd build forms for everything)
- ‚ùå Longer time to working product

**Is that worth it?** Or do you want to track your medical expenses sometime this month?

### The Real Question

**What's your actual goal?**

**1. "I want to understand how web apps work from scratch"**
‚Üí Flask is better. You'll wire everything up manually and understand each piece.

**2. "I want to build this insurance tracker and actually use it"**
‚Üí Django is better. Focus on your domain logic, not plumbing.

**3. "I want to become a professional developer"**
‚Üí Learn both eventually. Start with Django for structure, then Flask shows you what Django does behind the scenes.

### My Recommendation

**Stick with Django for this project because:**

1. You want to build something **useful quickly** (track real insurance data)
2. The admin interface lets you focus on logic, not building forms
3. You have a template already set up
4. Django's structure prevents beginner mistakes
5. When you understand Django, Flask will be trivial to learn later

**Consider Flask later when:**
- You understand databases, routing, templates, authentication
- You want to build a simple API
- You want to learn "how it works under the hood"
- You're building a microservice that does one thing

### The Analogy

- **Django** = Learning to drive with an automatic transmission car that has GPS, parking assist, and lane-keeping
- **Flask** = Learning to drive with a manual transmission and a paper map

Both get you there, but for a total beginner trying to accomplish a real goal (not just learn), the automatic car gets you driving safely much faster.

### The Bottom Line

**The best framework is the one that gets you building.**

Paralysis by analysis kills more beginner projects than choosing the "wrong" framework. Pick one, build something, ship it. You can always rebuild in Flask later if you want - but you'll have a working product in the meantime.

Django isn't "training wheels" - it's the framework that Instagram, Pinterest, and The Washington Post use in production. It scales from beginner projects to billion-user platforms.

Start with Django. Build your insurance tracker. Learn the concepts. Then evaluate if Flask makes sense for your next project.

## üîß Troubleshooting & Common Errors

### Understanding Django Error Pages

When something goes wrong, Django shows a detailed error page (when `DEBUG=True`). Here's how to read it:

**Anatomy of a Django error:**
```
Exception Type: ValueError
Exception Value: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
Exception Location: /path/to/your/file.py, line 42

Request Method: GET
Request URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/policy/abc/
```

**What to look at:**
1. **Exception Type** - What kind of error (ValueError, ImportError, etc.)
2. **Exception Value** - What went wrong in plain English
3. **Exception Location** - Which file and line number
4. **Request URL** - What page you were trying to access

**The traceback** (below the error) shows the path your code took to get to the error. Read from bottom to top - the bottom is where it broke.

---

### Common Errors & Solutions

#### 1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'**

**Error:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'
```

**What it means:** Python can't find Django. Your virtual environment isn't activated or Django isn't installed.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if virtual environment is active
which python
# Should show path with your virtualenv name

# If not active, activate it
pyenv local insurance-tracker

# Verify Django is installed
pip list | grep Django

# If Django is missing, install it
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### 2. **Port Already in Use (8000)**

**Error:**
```
Error: That port is already in use.
```

**What it means:** Something is already running on port 8000 (probably an old Django server you forgot to stop).

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Option 2: Use a different port
python manage.py runserver 8001

# Option 3: Close your terminal and open a new one
# (kills all processes from that terminal)
```

---

#### 3. **ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty**

**Error:**
```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty.
```

**What it means:** Django can't find the SECRET_KEY in settings.py

**Solutions:**
```python
# Open config/settings.py
# Find the SECRET_KEY line (around line 23)

# Make sure it looks like this:
SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-some-long-random-string-here'

# If it's trying to load from environment:
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'django-insecure-fallback-key-for-dev')
```

---

#### 4. **DoesNotExist: InsurancePolicy matching query does not exist**

**Error:**
```
apps.insurance.models.InsurancePolicy.DoesNotExist: InsurancePolicy matching query does not exist.
```

**What it means:** You're trying to access a database record that doesn't exist.

**Common causes:**
- Tried to access `/policy/1/` but there's no policy with ID=1
- Deleted data from admin but code still references it
- Wrong ID in URL

**Solutions:**
```python
# In views.py, use get_object_or_404 instead of .get()
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

# Change this:
policy = InsurancePolicy.objects.get(id=policy_id)

# To this (shows 404 page instead of error):
policy = get_object_or_404(InsurancePolicy, id=policy_id)
```

---

#### 5. **TemplateDoesNotExist: insurance/dashboard.html**

**Error:**
```
django.template.exceptions.TemplateDoesNotExist: insurance/dashboard.html
```

**What it means:** Django can't find your template file.

**Common causes:**
- Template is in wrong folder
- Typo in template name
- TEMPLATES setting misconfigured

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check your template location
ls templates/insurance/

# Make sure structure is:
# templates/
#   insurance/
#     dashboard.html
#     policy_detail.html

# If template exists but still not found, check settings.py:
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],  # Make sure this line exists
        ...
    }
]
```

---

#### 6. **No changes detected (when running makemigrations)**

**Error:**
```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
No changes detected
```

**What it means:** Django doesn't see any changes to your models, even though you changed them.

**Common causes:**
- App not in INSTALLED_APPS
- Syntax error in models.py
- Forgot to save the file

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check if your app is in INSTALLED_APPS (settings.py)
# Should have: 'apps.insurance'

# 2. Try specifying the app name
python manage.py makemigrations insurance

# 3. Check for syntax errors
python manage.py check

# 4. Make sure you saved models.py (CMD+S)
```

---

#### 7. **OperationalError: no such table: insurance_eobentry**

**Error:**
```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: insurance_eobentry
```

**What it means:** You're trying to query a database table that doesn't exist yet.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Run migrations to create tables
python manage.py migrate

# If that doesn't work, check if migrations exist
ls apps/insurance/migrations/

# If no migration files (except __init__.py), create them
python manage.py makemigrations insurance

# Then run migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

#### 8. **CSRF Verification Failed**

**Error:**
```
Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.
```

**What it means:** Django's security feature blocking your form submission.

**Solutions:**
```html
<!-- In your form template, make sure you have: -->
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}  <!-- ADD THIS LINE -->
    <!-- your form fields -->
</form>
```

---

#### 9. **Static Files Not Loading (CSS/Images)**

**Problem:** Page loads but no styling, images broken.

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Check settings.py has these lines:
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']

# 2. Make sure folder structure is:
# static/
#   css/
#     style.css
#   js/
#   images/

# 3. In templates, load static files:
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
</head>

# 4. Check urls.py includes this (for development):
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # your urls
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0])
```

---

#### 10. **Virtual Environment Not Activating**

**Problem:** Commands show wrong Python version or "django-admin not found"

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check what python you're using

### How to Debug Like a Pro

**Step-by-step debugging process:**

1. **Read the full error message** (don't just look at the first line)
2. **Find the line number** where error occurred
3. **Open that file** and look at that line
4. **Look at what variables exist** at that point
5. **Add print statements** to see values
6. **Google the error** (include "django" in search)
7. **Ask AI for help** (provide full error + relevant code)

**Using print() to debug:**
```python
def policy_detail(request, policy_id):
    print(f"Policy ID requested: {policy_id}")  # Debug
    print(f"Type: {type(policy_id)}")  # Debug

    policy = get_object_or_404(InsurancePolicy, id=policy_id)
    print(f"Found policy: {policy}")  # Debug

    # If you reach here, you'll see prints in terminal
```

**Using Django shell for testing:**
```bash
python manage.py shell

>>> from apps.insurance.models import InsurancePolicy
>>> policies = InsurancePolicy.objects.all()
>>> print(policies)
>>> # Test queries here without needing the web server
```

## üîÑ Basic Git Workflow

### Your First Commits

After your insurance tracker works, save your progress with Git:

```bash
# 1. See what changed
git status

# You'll see:
# - Red files = not staged
# - Green files = staged (ready to commit)

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add apps/insurance/models.py
git add templates/insurance/dashboard.html

# 3. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add insurance tracker with EOB models and dashboard"

# 4. View your commit history
git log --oneline
```

---

### Daily Git Workflow

**After each working feature:**

```bash
# 1. Save your work
git add .
git commit -m "Add category spending chart to policy detail page"

# 2. Before starting something new, check status
git status

# Should show: "working tree clean"
```

---

### Common Git Tasks

**See what changed:**
```bash
# Show which files changed
git status

# Show actual code differences
git diff

# Show differences for one file
git diff apps/insurance/views.py
```

**Undo mistakes:**
```bash
# Undo changes to ONE file (before committing)
git checkout -- apps/insurance/models.py

# Undo ALL changes (before committing) - CAREFUL!
git checkout -- .

# Unstage a file (keep changes, just remove from staging)
git reset HEAD apps/insurance/models.py

# Go back to previous commit (creates new commit)
git revert HEAD

# See last 5 commits
git log --oneline -5

# Go back to a specific commit (DESTRUCTIVE - lose changes)
git reset --hard abc123
```

**Branches (for experimenting):**
```bash
# Create a branch for new feature
git branch add-export-feature

# Switch to that branch
git checkout add-export-feature

# Or do both at once
git checkout -b add-export-feature

# Make changes, commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Add CSV export functionality"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge the feature in
git merge add-export-feature

# Delete the feature branch (after merging)
git branch -d add-export-feature
```

---

### When Things Go Wrong

**"I committed something by mistake!"**
```bash
# Undo last commit, keep the changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Now you can edit files and commit again
```

**"I broke everything, go back!"**
```bash
# See history
git log --oneline

# Find the good commit (like abc123), then
git reset --hard abc123

# WARNING: This deletes all changes after that commit!
```

**"I want to save work but try something else"**
```bash
# Stash your changes (temporary storage)
git stash

# Do other work, commit it...

# Bring back your stashed changes
git stash pop
```

---

## üîê Environment Variables & Secrets

### What Are Secrets?

**Secrets** are sensitive values you don't want in Git:
- `SECRET_KEY` (Django's encryption key)
- Database passwords
- API keys (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)
- Email passwords

**Why not commit them?**
- Your Git repo might become public
- Hackers scan GitHub for leaked keys
- Different environments need different values (dev vs production)

---

### Using .env Files

**1. Create a `.env` file** in your project root:
```bash
# .env
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

**2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:**
```bash
# .gitignore
.env
*.pyc
__pycache__/
db.sqlite3
```

**3. Load .env in settings.py:**
```python
# At the top of config/settings.py
from pathlib import Path
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Load .env file

# Now use environment variables
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback-key-for-dev')
DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'

# For database
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

**4. Create `.env.example` to commit:**
```bash
# .env.example (commit this)
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
```

This shows others what variables they need without exposing real values.

- Set source code: `/home/yourusername/InsuranceTracker`
- Set virtualenv: `/home/yourusername/.virtualenvs/insurance-tracker`

7. **Edit WSGI file** (link on Web tab):
```python
import os
import sys

path = '/home/yourusername/InsuranceTracker'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'config.settings'

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```

8. **Update settings.py for production:**

### Avoiding Tutorial Hell

**Tutorial Hell** = doing tutorial after tutorial without building your own projects.

**Signs you're stuck:**
- Completed 5+ tutorials but can't build anything alone
- Always need to follow along, can't code from scratch
- Afraid to start your own project

**How to escape:**
1. **Stop doing tutorials** (seriously)
2. **Pick a project idea** that solves YOUR problem
3. **Build it** (you'll get stuck - that's good!)
4. **Google when stuck** (specific questions get specific answers)
5. **Ask AI for help** (with context from your actual project)
6. **Finish it** (even if it's ugly - shipping matters)
7. **Repeat** with a harder project

**The rule:** After this guide, build 3 projects on your own before doing another tutorial.

## ‚ùì How to Ask for Help Effectively

### Creating Minimal Reproducible Examples

**Bad question:**
"My Django app doesn't work. Help?"

**Good question:**
"Getting DoesNotExist error when accessing policy detail page. Here's my view (code), model (code), and traceback (error). Policy with ID=1 exists in admin."

---

### Stack Overflow Etiquette

**Before posting:**
1. Google the error message
2. Search Stack Overflow for similar questions
3. Try debugging yourself (see Troubleshooting section)

**When posting:**
1. **Title**: Specific error + technology (e.g., "Django DoesNotExist error when querying InsurancePolicy")
2. **Problem**: What you're trying to do
3. **Expected**: What should happen
4. **Actual**: What actually happens (include error)
5. **Code**: Minimal code that reproduces issue
6. **Tried**: What you've already attempted

**Template:**
```markdown
## Problem
I'm trying to display a policy detail page, but getting a DoesNotExist error.

## Expected Behavior
Should show policy details for policy ID 1

## Actual Behavior
```
DoesNotExist: InsurancePolicy matching query does not exist.
```

## Code
```python
# views.py
def policy_detail(request, policy_id):
    policy = InsurancePolicy.objects.get(id=policy_id)
    return render(request, 'insurance/policy_detail.html', {'policy': policy})
```

## What I've Tried
- Verified policy with ID=1 exists in Django admin
- Checked INSTALLED_APPS includes 'apps.insurance'
- Ran migrations successfully

## Environment
- Django 5.0.1
- Python 3.13.3
- SQLite database
```

---

### Asking AI for Help

**Give context:**
```
I'm building a Django insurance tracker following this guide: [paste relevant section]

I'm trying to [what you want to do]

Here's my current code:
[paste models.py, views.py, and template]

I'm getting this error:
[paste full error]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

**Follow-up questions:**
- "Can you explain why that works?"
- "Is there a better way to do this?"
- "What are the security implications?"

## üéØ Key Takeaways

### Core Django Concepts to Master

1. **Models** = Your data structure (database tables)
2. **Views** = Your logic (what happens when URLs are accessed)
3. **Templates** = Your HTML (what users see)
4. **URLs** = Connect web addresses to views
5. **Admin** = Built-in interface to manage data
6. **Migrations** = Track database changes over time

**Remember:** Models ‚Üí Views ‚Üí Templates (MTV pattern)

---

### Best Practices for Beginners

1. **Commit often** (every time something works)
2. **Write simple code first** (optimize later)
3. **Use Django's built-ins** (don't reinvent the wheel)
4. **Read error messages carefully** (they tell you exactly what's wrong)
5. **Google before asking** (but don't spend hours stuck)
6. **Comment your code** (explain why, not what)
7. **Test in browser after every change** (catch errors early)
8. **Keep SECRET_KEY secret** (don't commit to Git)
9. **Use .gitignore** (don't commit db.sqlite3, .env, __pycache__)
10. **Ship something** (done is better than perfect)

---

### When You're Stuck

**The debugging checklist:**
- [ ] Read the full error message
- [ ] Check the file and line number mentioned
- [ ] Print variables to see their values
- [ ] Google the error message
- [ ] Check Django docs for that feature
- [ ] Ask AI with full context
- [ ] Post on Stack Overflow if still stuck
- [ ] Take a break (seriously, walk away for 15 minutes)

---

### Measuring Your Progress

**You're making progress when you:**
- ‚úÖ Can create a new Django app from scratch
- ‚úÖ Understand what models, views, templates do
- ‚úÖ Can read error messages and find the problem
- ‚úÖ Know where to look for answers (docs, Stack Overflow)
- ‚úÖ Can explain your code to someone else
- ‚úÖ Have shipped at least one working project

**You're NOT making progress when you:**
- ‚ùå Following tutorials without understanding
- ‚ùå Copying code without knowing why it works
- ‚ùå Afraid to experiment (break things!)
- ‚ùå Skipping errors (fix them, don't ignore)

---

### Final Advice

**From experienced developers to beginners:**

1. **Everyone was a beginner once.** Even the person who built Django.

2. **You will feel lost.** That feeling never fully goes away - you just get better at dealing with it.

3. **Build things you'll actually use.** Motivation matters more than perfect code.

4. **Don't compare yourself to others.** Compare yourself to yesterday's you.

5. **Ask for help.** The community wants you to succeed.

6. **Ship your projects.** Even if they're ugly, incomplete, or "not perfect."

7. **Take breaks.** Your brain learns while you're NOT coding too.

8. **Read other people's code.** Open source projects are free education.

9. **Write terrible code.** Then refactor it. That's how you learn.

10. **Enjoy the journey.** Building software is magic. You're creating something from nothing.

---

**You have everything you need to succeed.**

The tools are installed. The guide is complete. The AI assistants are ready to help. The only thing left is to start building.

What will you create?
